# Check, restore and re-pin the modules this repo vendors verbatim from their
# canonical home.
#
# The vendored copies are compared against the canonical file AT A PINNED
# COMMIT (scripts/vendored-pin), not against canonical main. Comparing against
# a moving main made the check fail on time rather than content: any PR opened
# after a canonical merge went red whatever it changed, and a canonical change
# could not land without first reasoning about which downstream PRs it would
# break (laurigates/comfyui-gallery-loader#92). The pin moves only in this
# repo's own commits, so a canonical merge cannot change a PR's status here.
# The scheduled "Vendored sync" workflow notices canonical drift instead, and
# opens the bump PR. Fetching by commit SHA also sidesteps the ~5 minute
# raw.githubusercontent.com cache, which only ever serves a stale `main`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/vendored.sh check [file...]  diff vendored copies against the pin (exit 1 on drift)
#   scripts/vendored.sh sync  [file...]  restore vendored copies from the pin
#   scripts/vendored.sh bump  [ref]      pin <ref> (default: main) and re-fetch every file
#   scripts/vendored.sh files            list the vendored files
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 drift (check only), 2 usage/config error or fetch failure.
