"""CI must pin the Node the JS suites run under, from one source of truth.

WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A COMMENT.

`bun run test` and `bun run test:e2e` do not run under bun. Both shell out to a
Node bin (`vitest`, `playwright`) whose shebang is `env node`, so the runtime is
the runner image's Node — a version nothing in this repo declares.

That is load-bearing rather than cosmetic, because the runtime decides which
`Storage` implementation the jsdom suite exercises. Measured locally, no flags:

    node 22.21.1   'localStorage' in globalThis -> False
    node 24.0.0    'localStorage' in globalThis -> False   (True with --experimental-webstorage)
    node 24.19.0   'localStorage' in globalThis -> False
    node 25.0.0    'localStorage' in globalThis -> True
    node 26.5.0    'localStorage' in globalThis -> True

So the built-in accessor is unflagged from **v25**, not from v22.4 (v22.4 is
where the *flag* landed — issue #40 conflated the two). Where the accessor
exists it evaluates to `undefined` without `--localstorage-file`, and vitest
copies jsdom's window globals onto `globalThis` only where the name is ABSENT,
so jsdom's real Storage never lands and `tests/js/setup-jsdom.js` installs its
in-memory shim instead. Below v25 there is no accessor, jsdom's Storage lands,
and the shim's guard is false.

Both paths are green today. The problem is that they are DIFFERENT paths, and
without a pin CI silently picks one while every developer picks the other — so
a shim-only regression cannot be caught by CI, and a jsdom-Storage-only one
cannot be caught locally. The pin is what makes the two sides agree.

This test exists because the pin lives in a workflow file that nothing else
reads: a new Node-running job added later, or a hand-edit dropping the step,
restores the divergence with no other signal.
