// Playwright config for the BROWSER suite — deliberately separate from
// vitest.config.js.
//
// The two suites are different environments answering different questions and
// must stay separately runnable:
//   `bun run test`     → vitest/jsdom, tests/js/**, no layout engine
//   `bun run test:e2e` → this config, tests/e2e/**, real Chromium with layout
// vitest's `include` is scoped to `tests/js/**/*.test.js` and this config's
// testMatch is scoped to `*.spec.js`, so neither runner can pick up the other's
// files even by accident.

// ---- Port -------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A FIXED port plus `reuseExistingServer` is a trap for concurrent runs on one
// checkout: the second run finds the first run's server, attaches to it instead
// of starting its own, and then the first run finishes and tears it down —
// leaving the second with a cascade of `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` that reads
// as a product regression rather than as a harness collision (observed: five
// passes, two 20-second `toHaveCount` timeouts, then twenty instant failures).
// So each run picks its OWN port unless one is named explicitly.
//
// `IB_E2E_PORT` is written back into the environment because Playwright
// re-imports this config in every worker process: without the write-back each
// process would derive its own port from its own pid and the workers would
// address a server that is not there. Setting it explicitly is also how you opt
// INTO sharing a server (`IB_E2E_PORT=8199 bun run test:e2e` in one shell, then
// another) — that is the case `reuseExistingServer` exists for.

// This environment has Chromium PRE-INSTALLED under PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH at
// build revision 1194 (Chromium 141.0.7390.37) and NO network path to download
// another one — `playwright install` must never run. Playwright resolves its
// browser by revision, so the @playwright/test version is load-bearing: it is
// pinned (exact, no caret) to the release whose expected chromium revision is
// the one on disk. If a dependency bump ever breaks that match we point
// executablePath at the binary we have rather than let Playwright try to fetch
// one — a download attempt fails slowly and confusingly, an explicit path fails
// immediately and legibly.
