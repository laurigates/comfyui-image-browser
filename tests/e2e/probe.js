// The question these probes exist to answer is NOT "did the offset survive" —
// it is *when* it was lost:
//
//   lost AT ASSIGNMENT  → the engine clamped, because the content was not (yet)
//                         tall enough for the offset we asked for. Fixing that
//                         means restoring later, or against a taller box.
//   lost AFTER          → the assignment took, and something moved it
//                         afterwards (scroll anchoring, a reflow, a second
//                         assignment). Fixing that means finding the mover.
//
// Inferring that distinction from a final `scrollTop` read is impossible, so we
// wrap the setter: `immediate` is read back in the SAME synchronous task as the
// write (uncontaminated by anything later), next to the `scrollHeight` /
// `clientHeight` that were in force when the write happened — i.e. the clamp
// bound that decided the outcome. Everything after that is a separate,
// timestamped record.
